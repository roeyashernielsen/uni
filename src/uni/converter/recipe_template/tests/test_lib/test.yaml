# This generic configuration should be good in most cases to run pytests.
# So, don't play with this file unless you are 100% sure what you are doing.
# Tests will be executed suite by suite (test suite is a directory located under 'tests' directory
# that starts with 'test_' and that contains one or more test files that start with 'test_')
# Following environmental variables are available:
# $TEST_SUITE_PATH is the relative path to the test suite from the recipe root.
# $TEST_SUITE_NAME is the name of the test suite
# $COVERAGE_REPORT_DIR is the relative path to the coverage reports directory under recipe root
# $TEST_REPORT_DIR is the relative path to the test reports directory under recipe root
# --cov ./: invoke pytest-cov for current directory
# --cov-report term-missing: terminal report with line numbers
# --cov-report xml:/...: creates xml report at designated output
#
# Config Parameters
#  - image - the docker image that the tests will run in
#  - test_command - the test command that will be executed inside of the image
#  - memory - the amount of RAM that the test pod will use in Gigabytes (G) (e.g. 'memory: 4G')
config:
    image: spark2.4.4-python3.7-worker
    memory: 4G
